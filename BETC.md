# **stage 1:**


## **task 2:**


## **IDE:**

### **1.tools:**

**1- Visual Studio Code:** Visual Studio Code is a source code editor created by microsoft for windows, linux and macOS. features include debugging support, syntax highlighting, smart coding, captions, reuse code, and embedded git.

>Instead of a project plan, it allows users to open one or more indexes, which can be stored in the workspace for future use. This allows it to act as an agnostic language editor of any language. It supports multiple programming languages ​​and a set of unique features for each language. any file you want to remove or get rid off you can be romved from the tree using the settings. many features of the visual studio code are not displayed in the menus or user interface but can be accessed using the terminal.

<br />

<br />

**2- PyCharm:** available as a cross app, PyCharm is compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms. Sitting well among the best python IDEs, PyCharm provides support for both Python 2 and Python 3 and above versions.

>PyCharm comes with many useful tools, incridable packages and tools to accelerate Python development while minimizing the required effort to do the same amount of work on a huge scale. In addition, PyCharm can be customized according to development needs, and preferred by personal preferences. It was released to the public for the first time back in February 2010. In addition to providing code analysis, PyCharm features:
>
>  - Click debugger
>  - Integrated unit tester
>  - Support for the integration of type control systems (VCSs)
>  - Data science support with Anaconda

<br />

## **Operating Systems:**

**1- Windows:** Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as windows or just win, is a group of multimedia families, all of which are made and sold by microsoft. its a graphical program developed and published by Microsoft. it provides a way to save files, run software, play games, watch videos, and connect to the Internet.

Microsoft Windows was first released on version 1.0 on November 10, 1983. More than a dozens of versions on Windows have been released since then, including the current version, Windows 10 and windows 11.

In general, window is a fundamental part of a computer. and an area of the display area to containing a single running application. The window can be moved, resized, hidden, or maximized as desired by the user.

<br />

**2- Linux:**
Like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the world's most popular platforms, Android, is powered by Linux operating system. Linux has been around since the mid 1990s and has since reached the user base across the globe. Linux is actually everywhere and powering most of our daily devices. you can find it on your phones, on thermostats, on your cars, on refrigerators and on televisions. It also uses the majority of the Internet, all the top 500 supercomputers in the world, as well as the world's stock exchange.

<br />
<br />

## **Version-control platform:**

**1- GitHub:**
To understand GitHub, you must first get a closer look on what is **git**. git is an open source version program developed by linux (torvalds) the same person who created linux. git is similar to other version control programs CVS, and Mercurial.

so basically git is a version control system, similar but better than many other methods available. So, what makes **GitHub** so special? git is a command line tool, but the center where everything that includes Git revolve is a hub [GitHub.com](GitHub.com) where developers keep their projects and network with other people.

<br />
<br />

**2- GitLab:**
gitLab started out as an open source project to help teams collaborate on software development. The goal of gitLab is to provide a place where everyone can contribute. gitLab is a single program that extends the lifetime of software development. These silos take over the integration, management, configuration, and retention, reducing the qulity of your teamwork and your posting. Moving to a single app will speed up your workflow and help you deliver better, faster software.

## **2.explenation:**

**IDE:** for the i used the Visual Studio Code because my work is bassed on web development which means i need to work with HTML, CSS and javascript.

and the PyCharm is for python developers so it wont be as handy as the visual studio.

<br />

**operating system:** my main work is on windows because am used to work with this operating system and know how to deal with it but for that doesnt mean i cant use the LINUX terminal for my file confermation and config, so my work is mixed between both of them because you cant deny their benifits for me as a web developer and a programmer.

<br />

**Version-control platform:** for me using GitHub is better for my current work, some of these benifits is that my code can be reviewed by many people with better experience and tallents, beside all of that it has a tons of open source whaich means it allows anyone to review and propose changes to the code. 

plus because of the breadth of the GitHub community, you can sometimes find programmers working on similar projects or who have skills, experiences, or a vision that offers a good fit for your organization.

# Task 1:

## 1- 
we decided to create a **website** that combains the homeless animals that in need for adopting and a new home and caring family to take care of, by adressing this porblem we created an adoption page, where you can checkout all the animals we share in need for help and donation, the user can enter the **website** have a look at either cats or dogs and even read about animals and how to correctly take care of them and the benifits of adopting animals.

by clicking on the animal you can see more information about them and read more about thier personalitys to see how well this animal matches you and if you can take care of him/her.

for the stakeholders they requisted a fully working web aplecation that alows them to add the animal they decided to add to something like a cart and to check more information about the animal by clicking on it and showing them the full info about every an each animal they decieded they would like to see.

## 2-
- one of the risks we might face is change in the stakeholders for example changing in there opinion suddenly or asking for sudden change in the middle of the working proccess and change their scope.

- stakeholder expectation: The main purpose of this process is to identify who the stakeholders are and how they intend to use the product. so keeping them interested is one of the main keys to have a succesful website and working business so losing thier interest would be one of the huges risks we might face.
and making sure taht we can understand those requirments and reach excatly what does those stake holder have in mind


<br>

the process of managing stakeholders is comprised of the following key elements:

**we have to follow these tips:**

**Stakeholder expectations:** when stakeholder expectations are actively managed, the project achieves high levels of success. The project manager must continue to negotiate and contribute to stakeholder aspirations to achieve a strong alignment of project goals and expectations and to maintain a project management effort.

**Managing stakeholder vision:** it is important for the success of the project to ensure that participants participate in the project in a structured way and are aware of the current state of project work. The vision of high level stakeholders increases the interest that participants will provide the required level of funding and the project can be carried out as expected.

**Recording the work of the participants:** the project manager is ultimately responsible for recording and signing up for all the activities performed by the participants. Therefore, the project manager should formally monitor all stakeholder communication with each other and make a record of the results that the project has achieved, in order to protect stakeholder acceptance and adherence to the project communication plan.

- another one of the risk that we faced is the organized scheduling, and knowing how and where should everyone work and deliver his best for not everyone is capable to work in the same invironment as everyone and same goes for the working hours.

<hr>

# 3- 
## function and requirments:
- the system must have a descriptive and organized home page not too complicated not too simple mix in between.

- the system must have all the pages and button connected directly to the pages they described and directed to.

- the adoption page must contain all the animals and small inro about them.

- the system should alow the user to check more information about each and every animal they decid to click on to preview more information and bref explenation about their personlaitys.

- the system should show the users choice of adoption.

- the user should be able to more around the website easily.

## database design:

for our program we didnt take learn how to connect the database to work like my sql and other programs, but we learned about the local storage that saves the information in the website.

## activity diagram

## home page:

<img src="imgs/home page wireframe.PNG" alt="">

here we as we can see is the wireframe of the homepage where we can pick have a quick look and idea about what we can find in this website and what its all about.
<br>
<hr>
<img src="imgs/chosing wire frame.PNG" alt="">
<br>
here the user can choose either he would like to see cats or dogs sections as we can see a very simiple and clear design for the user to intaract with.

<br>
<hr>
<img src="imgs/buying adopting page.PNG" alt="">
<br></br>
the adoption page alows the user to see and have a clear visson of the animals we have on our website, for the dogs part it got supperated from the cat section in the live URL and the animal facts 
is now an individual page.
<br>
<hr>
<img src="imgs/about us.PNG" alt="">
<br></br>

and lastly the about us page this page shows the team members and a breaf look into each one of them.


<img src="imgs/activity diagrams.png" alt="">

<br></br>

and up here we have the avtivity diagram explaining our working proccess.

<br>

<hr>

## coding and implementation:

we decided to us the waterfall technique fow our work the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

we decided to use this techinque for multiple reasons some of them were:

- Requirements are clear.
- There are no ambiguous requirements.
- It is good to use this model when the technology is well understood.
- The project is short and cast is low.
- Risk is zero or minimum.

## testing:
done in stage 3

<hr>

## task 2:

### 3- 
**vs code:** i used the vs code for my job is based on creating a web applecation for it contains and supports mainly the HTML, CSS and JS
as main working stations the PyCharm is mainly used for python developers so i wont need it for my work.

**Linux:** i choose linux for it can alow me to send(push), receive(pull) and clone my work with my colleague in the project for it connected to my git hub account and my working station.

**GitHub:** github alows us developers to push our work into organizations and work on it as a team and check others developers codes and work and share knowladge between us, not only in the workplace, but also personally. It's the most popular source code hosting facility out there, and it's still growing.

adding our daily documintations and showcase our progress across the team members, and most importantly track changes and edits in the group project.
