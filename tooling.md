# **stage 1:**


## **task 2:**


## **IDE:**

### **1.tools:**

**1- Visual Studio Code:** Visual Studio Code is a source code editor created by microsoft for windows, linux and macOS. features include debugging support, syntax highlighting, smart coding, captions, reuse code, and embedded git.

>Instead of a project plan, it allows users to open one or more indexes, which can be stored in the workspace for future use. This allows it to act as an agnostic language editor of any language. It supports multiple programming languages ​​and a set of unique features for each language. any file you want to remove or get rid off you can be romved from the tree using the settings. many features of the visual studio code are not displayed in the menus or user interface but can be accessed using the terminal.

<br />

**2- PyCharm:** available as a cross app, PyCharm is compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms. Sitting well among the best python IDEs, PyCharm provides support for both Python 2 and Python 3 and above versions.

>PyCharm comes with many useful tools, incridable packages and tools to accelerate Python development while minimizing the required effort to do the same amount of work on a huge scale. In addition, PyCharm can be customized according to development needs, and preferred by personal preferences. It was released to the public for the first time back in February 2010. In addition to providing code analysis, PyCharm features:
>
>  - Click debugger
>  - Integrated unit tester
>  - Support for the integration of type control systems (VCSs)
>  - Data science support with Anaconda

## **Operating Systems:**

**1- Windows:** Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as windows or just win, is a group of multimedia families, all of which are made and sold by microsoft. its a graphical program developed and published by Microsoft. it provides a way to save files, run software, play games, watch videos, and connect to the Internet.

Microsoft Windows was first released on version 1.0 on November 10, 1983. More than a dozens of versions on Windows have been released since then, including the current version, Windows 10 and windows 11.

In general, window is a fundamental part of a computer. and an area of the display area to containing a single running application. The window can be moved, resized, hidden, or maximized as desired by the user.

**2- Linux:**
Like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the world's most popular platforms, Android, is powered by Linux operating system. Linux has been around since the mid 1990s and has since reached the user base across the globe. Linux is actually everywhere and powering most of our daily devices. you can find it on your phones, on thermostats, on your cars, on refrigerators and on televisions. It also uses the majority of the Internet, all the top 500 supercomputers in the world, as well as the world's stock exchange.

<br />

## **Version-control platform:**

**1- GitHub:**
To understand GitHub, you must first get a closer look on what is **git**. git is an open source version program developed by linux (torvalds) the same person who created linux. git is similar to other version control programs CVS, and Mercurial.

so basically git is a version control system, similar but better than many other methods available. So, what makes **GitHub** so special? git is a command line tool, but the center where everything that includes Git revolve is a hub [GitHub.com](GitHub.com) where developers keep their projects and network with other people.

<br />
<br />

**2- GitLab:**
gitLab started out as an open source project to help teams collaborate on software development. The goal of gitLab is to provide a place where everyone can contribute. gitLab is a single program that extends the lifetime of software development. These silos take over the integration, management, configuration, and retention, reducing the qulity of your teamwork and your posting. Moving to a single app will speed up your workflow and help you deliver better, faster software.

## **2.explenation:**

**IDE:** for the i used the Visual Studio Code because my work is bassed on web development which means i need to work with HTML, CSS and javascript.

and the PyCharm is for python developers so it wont be as handy as the visual studio.

<br />

**operating system:** my main work is on windows because am used to work with this operating system and know how to deal with it but for that doesnt mean i cant use the LINUX terminal for my file confermation and config, so my work is mixed between both of them because you cant deny their benifits for me as a developer.

<br />

**Version-control platform:** for me using GitHub is better for my current work, some of these benifits is that my code can be reviewed by many people with better experience and tallents, beside all of that it has a tons of open source whaich means it allows anyone to review and propose changes to the code. 

plus because of the breadth of the GitHub community, you can sometimes find programmers working on similar projects or who have skills, experiences, or a vision that offers a good fit for your organization.
